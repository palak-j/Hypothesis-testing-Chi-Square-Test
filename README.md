# Hypothesis-testing-Chi-Square-Test

##### Chi square (áµª2) test are used with nominal data.
##### T-test and ANOVA can be used with continuous data only.
##### With nominal data, we usually calculate frequency of each group.
##### Chi-square evaluates whether the frequencies of categories actually observed( observed frequencies, f0 ) match with the frequency you expect if randomly selected from null-hypothesis population (expected frequencies, fe ).
##### Chi-square test is also called a goodness-of-fit test.

##### Chi-square is the sum of the squared differences between observed and expected frequencies, each divided by the expected frequency.

### Example 1
If we conduct an experiment in which we randomly sample 150 beer drinkers and let them taste the three leading brands.  We want to know whether there is a difference in their preference for the three brands of light beer?

##### Preference for brands:

##### Brand A	Brand B	Brand C	Total 
##### 45	40	65	150



### Example 2
Consider we randomly sample of 200 Republicans and 200 Democrats and ask them whether they are in favor of a particular bill or against the bill or undecided. 
Contingency table is:
       
For Republican party:
For - 68
Undecided - 22
Against - 110

For Democrat party:
For - 92
Undecided - 18
Against - 90
